# CodingPatterns

This repository categorizes coding problems into a set of 16 patterns. 
Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques - to solve a specific category of problems. 
The goal is to develop an understanding of the underlying pattern, so that, we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.
